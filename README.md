# Employee Data Analysis

# Employee Analysis Project ðŸŽ¯

## Overview
This repository contains code and analysis for exploring and predicting outcomes from an employee dataset. Using Python and machine learning, the project performs detailed analysis to uncover insights into employee attrition, job roles, and overtime trends.

## Features
### Data Analysis
- Processed 1,000+ employee records
- Conducted exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and relationships

### Machine Learning
- Implemented a Random Forest Classifier for predictive modeling
- Used cross-validation to ensure model robustness
- Evaluated model performance using metrics like F1-score and accuracy

### Feature Importance Analysis
Key features driving predictions include:
- Work-Life Balance
- Job Role
- Monthly Income

## Key Functions

### 1. Data Preparation
- One-hot encoding for categorical variables
- Splitting data into train-test sets

### 2. Predictive Modeling
- Trained a Random Forest Classifier
- Optimized model performance through hyperparameter tuning

### 3. Evaluation
- Implemented comprehensive metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score
- Addressed overfitting through cross-validation and resampling techniques

### 4. Feature Analysis
- Ranked features by importance to the model
- Generated visualizations for better interpretability

## Results
- Achieved balanced performance across multiple target features
- Gained actionable insights for HR decision-making
